<h1><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>Transport decarbonisation refers to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from mobility systems through strategies such as minimizing unnecessary travel, promoting sustainable modes of transport, and adopting carbon-neutral vehicles and energy sources (Bayarsaikhan and Gim, 2022). Globally, transportation is the second-largest contributor to carbon emissions, accounting for 17% of total emissions, with road transport responsible for 44% of this share (Li et al., 2024). In Africa, emissions have surged by 43%, driven by rapid urbanization and rising transport demand, with sub-Saharan Africa alone contributing 40% of the continent’s transport-related emissions (World Bank, 2024)</p>
<p>Many African countries, including Nigeria, face structural and economic constraints that limit their ability to transition to low-carbon transport systems. With over 80% of vehicle imports in markets such as Nigeria and Kenya consisting of pre-owned models from Europe, Japan, and the United States (Altenburg et al., 2025), the region continues to depend on fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Meanwhile, European cities and the European Union are advancing toward a complete phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, aiming to transition to zero-emission transport systems (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2023).</p>
<p>While these dynamics play out at the national and regional levels, their impacts are most visible in rapidly growing urban cities, for instance as in the case of Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, which serves as a model for urban development throughout country. However, its rapid urban growth is currently estimated at 8.32% per annum (Abubakar, 2014). These have led to significant challenges, including increased private vehicle ownership, traffic congestion, and rising levels of air pollution; these issues threaten the city’s long-term sustainability and undermine Nigeria’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, which includes a pledge to reduce national carbon emissions by 20% (UNFCCC, 2015).</p>
<p>Strategies such as the 15-minute city, which have gained a lot of attention in European cities highlight the potential of compact, mixed-use urban design to reduce vehicle dependency (Zaheer et al., 2022; Moreno, 2021). However, the applicability of such models to rapidly urbanising African cities like Abuja remains underexplored, raising critical questions about how planning frameworks can address growing transportation and climate challenges.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-problem-and-rationale" class="level1">
<h1><strong>1.1 Research Problem and Rationale</strong></h1>
<p>Rapid population growth, largely driven by migration, has intensified travel demand in Abuja. Although the city is served by an extensive expressway network, its transport infrastructure remains predominantly car-centric, with limited provision for pedestrian and cycling routes (Bianchi Alves et al., 2023). Informal settlements constrain accessibility, while the 1979 Master Plan revised only once with a narrow focus on the central business district, these has proven inadequate for the realities of a rapidly expanding metropolis (Abubakar, 2014; Ismail et al., 2024). As in many LMICs, the widespread reliance on informal transport services (Visagie et al., 2021) underscores the absence of spatially responsive and inclusive mobility planning.</p>
<p>This resulted in severe traffic congestion, as Abuja’s daytime population surged to nearly seven million (Abubakar, 2014). Commuters from surrounding satellite towns often suffer longer commuting journeys of up to two to three hours, resulting in productivity losses and increased carbon emissions (OECD et al., 2025). The city’s dependence on private automobiles, coupled with the slow development of mass transit and non-motorized systems, has resulted in unsustainable mobility patterns and worsened environmental degradation (OECD et al., 2025).</p>
<p>Adding to these challenges is a critical data gap. Abuja lacks reliable and standardized datasets on transport operations, particularly bus and informal transit services, making it difficult to capture actual commuting patterns. Moreover, Nigeria’s last national population and housing census was conducted in 2005, leaving planners with outdated demographic baselines and limited understanding of the scale and distribution of travel demand. As a result, current planning efforts rely heavily on infrastructure expansion without detailed spatial analysis of how people move through the city.</p>
<p>This study addresses these gaps by developing an origin-destination model of commuting patterns in Abuja. By mapping the spatial structure of trips into and within the city, this research provides an empirical foundation for understanding accessibility, identifying mobility inequalities, and assessing how integrated transport planning and alternative frameworks such as the 15-minute city could contribute to more sustainable, low-carbon urban transport development.</p>
<section id="research-aim" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-aim"><strong>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Research Aim</strong></h2>
<p>To model and analyse commuting flows in Abuja, Nigeria, using an origin-destination approach to reveal spatial patterns of travel demand, accessibility, and emissions, and to generate evidence for adapting sustainable mobility frameworks.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-questions"><strong>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Research Questions</strong></h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the dominant commuting flows within Abuja and how do they contribute to congestion and emissions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do commuting patterns shape accessibility and transport inequality across Abuja?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can empirical insights into commuting flows support the contextual adaptation of sustainable mobility frameworks, such as the 15-minute city, in Abuja?</p>
</section>
<section id="objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives"><strong>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To analyse commuting flows between administrative wards and key points of interest (POIs) in Abuja using an OD model.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To identify high-demand corridors and assess how Abuja’s urban form and transport infrastructure influence travel behaviour.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine spatial disparities in transport accessibility and potential exposure to emissions across different neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide policy-relevant recommendations for adapting integrated mobility frameworks such as the 15-minute city to Abuja’s context.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="significance-of-the-study"><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></h2>
<section id="academic-significance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-significance"><strong>1.4.1 Academic Significance</strong></h3>
<p>This study is an addition to the increasing number of research on sustainable mobility and urban spatial data science, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where population growth frequently outpaces access to transportation planning tools and technological advancements. To close this gap, it uses a reproducible origin-destination (OD) modelling framework that combines Python-based tools with open geospatial data, extending methodological techniques for analysing travel demand in urban situations with little data. The connection between travel demand research and proximity-based frameworks, such the 15-minute city, is important because it closes the gap between technological modelling and urban planning theory.</p>
</section>
<section id="practical-significance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-significance"><strong>1.4.2 Practical Significance</strong></h3>
<p>Practically, this study provides planners and decision makers in Abuja with an up to date data-driven tool for identifying high-demand corridors and spatial patterns of transportation activity. The combination of gridded population estimates, and POI-based trip attractors allows for targeted interventions for low-carbon mobility, even in the absence of typical home travel surveys. More so, the workflow is based on open-source platforms and scalable approaches, it can be applied in other rapidly urbanising cities just like in the case of Abuja, which can provide a framework for designing relevant and sustainable transportation solutions.</p>
</section>
<section id="policy-significance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-significance">1.4.3 Policy Significance</h3>
<p>In terms of policy, this study directly supports Nigeria’s national and international climate action obligations. Nigeria signed the Paris Agreement, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions and seek low-carbon options. This commitment is reinforced by the Climate Change Act (2021), which establishes a legal framework for promoting inclusive green growth and sets a net-zero emissions target for 2050 to 2070. The Act requires the incorporation of climate factors into national and sectoral planning, particularly the transportation sector, where emissions remain a significant challenge.</p>
<p>At the city level, Abuja has begun to pilot sustainable transport initiatives such as the eco-friendly “Green Bus” project, which explores the deployment of natural gas-powered mass transit vehicles to reduce urban emissions (FCTA, 2021). However, the absence of reliable commuting data and spatial analysis tools limits the ability of planners to design and scale such interventions effectively. By developing an origin-destination (OD) model of Abuja’s commuting flows, this study provides empirical evidence to guide where and how low-carbon transport strategies could be implemented to achieve maximum result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study supports the realization of key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 11 on sustainable cities, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 10 on reducing inequalities, and SDG 3 on health and well-being. Table 1.1 summarizes the specific targets and how this study contributes to their achievement through OD-based analysis of commuting patterns, accessibility, and emissions exposure.</p>
<p>This study aligns with Nigeria’s national climate commitments and Abuja’s emerging low-carbon mobility initiatives, while also advancing the global sustainability agenda. By providing evidence-based insights through origin-destination modelling, it offers a robust foundation for designing inclusive, equitable, and low-emission transport policies in data-scarce urban contexts.</p>

<p>On a wider note, this research contributes to the field of urban studies and governance by offering scalable, reproducible methods for infrastructure planning in data-scarce region. It provides insights for policymakers seeking to align transport planning with climate resilience, equity, and digital innovation particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where significant data gaps continue to hinder evidence-based transportation planning and decarbonisation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope"><strong>1.5 Scope</strong></h2>
<p>This study focuses on Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory (FCT), specifically Abuja and its 78 administrative wards. The analysis is targeted within the city boundaries and centres on travel flows between residential areas and key points of interest, including schools, hospitals, markets, and public institutions. The research examines road transport carbon emissions through travel demand modelling, spatial accessibility analysis, and urban planning strategies. It seeks to provides a static snapshot of travel behaviour based on the most recent gridded population estimates available in 2025.</p>
<p>While the strategy is scalable and transferable to other low- and middle-income cities, the findings are context-specific and should be interpreted cautiously outside Abuja. These limitations also suggest avenues for future research, such as model calibration with ground-truth data, integration of real-time traffic metrics, and expansion to multimodal transport systems.</p>
